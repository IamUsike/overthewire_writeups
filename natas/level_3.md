- like the previous challenge, the landing page in this also shows the banner "there's nothing on this page"

- `robots.txt` is a file in wepapps to tell crawlers what to crawl through.

- inspect that to find the name of the dir

```robots.txt
http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/robots.txt
```
