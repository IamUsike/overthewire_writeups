**task**: Good job getting a shell! Now hurry and grab the password for bandit27!

- pretty simple. There a binary in the users home dir with `suid` bit set.
- use the `--help` arg with the binary to get what that binary is doing.
- later cat the bandit27 password using the binary's capabilites (suid mb)
